# Interbeing - Multi-Impact Habit Tracker

## Overview

Interbeing is a full-stack web application that combines personal habit tracking with real environmental impact actions. Users can create and track daily habits while triggering authentic environmental impact through the Greenspark API - including tree planting (üå≥), plastic rescue (üêã), carbon offsetting (‚òÅÔ∏è), kelp planting (üåø), clean water provision (üíß), and bee sponsorship (üêù). Each habit can be customized with specific impact actions and amounts, creating a powerful connection between personal growth and environmental responsibility. The application features a clean, nature-inspired interface built with modern React components and a robust Express.js backend with full user authentication.
